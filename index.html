            <div class="question">
                What's one thing that you can do for hours without losing energy or focus? (This could be a skill, a task, or a hobby)
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Honestly? Getting lost in market research rabbit holes. I know it sounds nerdy, but there's something addictive about piecing together competitor strategies and finding those "aha" moments in the data. At AICAN, I'd start looking at one SaaS competitor and three hours later I'd have mapped out their entire pricing strategy, feature positioning, and target segments. My teammates used to joke that I'd emerge from these research sessions with this weird excitement about some pricing insight I'd discovered. It doesn't feel like work when you're genuinely curious about how businesses tick.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                Where do you draw your energy from‚Äîwhether it's a task, person, or activity? Explain.
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Building things that work without me having to babysit them. There's this rush I get when I create a system and then watch it just... run. Like at AICAN, I built these automated workflows for lead scoring, and weeks later I'd see qualified leads still flowing through perfectly. It's like setting up dominoes - the real satisfaction isn't in placing each piece, it's in watching the whole thing cascade. I think I'm addicted to that multiplier effect where your effort today keeps paying dividends tomorrow. Maybe it's the lazy person in me who wants to work smart, not just hard.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                How do you feel about ambiguity in your work?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                I actually love it, which probably makes me weird. Most people want clear instructions, but give me a vague problem and I get excited. When I started Magmaroon, literally nobody could tell me "here's how you build a streetwear brand for Gen Z." I had to figure out everything - from finding manufacturers to cracking Instagram's algorithm. Sure, it was terrifying sometimes, but that's also where the magic happens. Ambiguity means I get to be creative, experiment, and potentially discover something nobody's tried before. It's like being handed a blank canvas instead of a coloring book.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                What's one thing that makes you impatient or frustrated? How do you deal with it?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Watching people do repetitive manual work when there's obviously a better way. It physically pains me. At Bluebird, I watched the sales team manually update spreadsheets for pipeline tracking and I was like "guys, this is 2024." I couldn't just sit there complaining though - that's not helpful to anyone. So I channeled that frustration into building them custom CRM templates. I've learned that my impatience is actually useful if I direct it toward solutions instead of just being annoyed. Now when I see inefficiency, I ask myself: "How can I fix this?" instead of "Why are they doing it this way?"
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                How do you handle stress and pressure? Share a recent example where you dealt with a challenging situation.
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                I turn into this weird analytical robot, but in a good way. At AICAN, we were behind on our quarterly pipeline targets with just weeks left, and everyone was starting to panic. While others were having crisis meetings, I locked myself away with our conversion data and found that our demo-booking rate was killing us. Instead of working harder on the same broken process, I rebuilt our messaging framework using AI-generated variations. We boosted demo bookings by 18% and hit our targets. I guess pressure makes me laser-focused on what actually moves the needle versus what just feels productive.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                Rate your ability to execute quickly under pressure
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                9 - I actually perform better under pressure, which might be a character flaw. At Krishna Exports, I had one month to analyze 30+ SKUs and somehow managed to find 8% in cost savings. At Bluebird, I closed 3 contracts in a month by rapidly testing different approaches with local market data. I think deadline pressure forces me to cut through perfectionism and focus on what actually matters. The fear of failing makes me ruthlessly prioritize and move fast on high-impact activities.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                What's something you've learned the hard way?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                That you can't fall in love with your assumptions. With Magmaroon, I was so convinced that amazing product design would sell itself that I spent months perfecting designs before really talking to customers. Turns out, my idea of "amazing" wasn't matching what people actually wanted to buy. I burned through time and money before realizing I was building for myself, not my market. Now I'm almost paranoid about validating everything early. It hurt my ego at the time, but it taught me that the market is always right, even when it's inconvenient.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                Rate your level of self-sufficiency when it comes to getting things done
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                I always need direction - but hear me out. I'm not helpless; I just hate wasting effort on the wrong things. Give me context and clear objectives, and I'll run with it independently. At AICAN, once I understood our ICP and pipeline goals, I built entire automated systems without handholding. But I'd rather ask clarifying questions upfront than spend weeks building something that misses the mark. I think there's a difference between needing direction and needing micromanagement - I definitely don't need the latter.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                Describe a time when you took something from idea to execution. What did you learn?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Magmaroon was my crash course in reality. I had this romanticized vision of building a cool streetwear brand, but execution taught me it's all about unglamorous details - inventory management, customer service workflows, ad optimization. The biggest lesson? The market doesn't care about your perfect plan. I learned more from my first week of actual sales than months of "strategic planning." Now I'm obsessed with getting to market quickly and letting real feedback guide iteration. Perfect is the enemy of good, and good enough to test is where you start learning.

            <div class="question">
                Imagine you're in charge of the marketing campaign for Duolingo. What's your first move and why?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Before I touch any creative campaigns, I need to understand why people quit. Duolingo's real challenge isn't getting people to download - it's keeping them engaged past week two. I'd dive deep into user behavior data to find the exact moments where people drop off and what keeps the power users coming back. Are people quitting because lessons feel too hard? Too easy? Too boring? Once I understand the psychology of both churners and champions, then I can build campaigns that address the real barriers to long-term engagement. Marketing can't fix a retention problem, but it can target the right solution to the right moment.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                What's a risk you've taken that didn't pay off the way you hoped? How you feel about it and What did you learn from it?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Going all-in on Instagram for Magmaroon without testing other channels first. I was so sure Instagram was the perfect fit for a youth brand that I put most of my marketing budget there. We hit 80k in sales, which sounds good, but our CAC was probably 40% higher than it needed to be. I felt stupid because the data was right there - I just got caught up in what seemed "obvious." Now I'm religious about testing multiple channels with small budgets before committing big. Sometimes the obvious choice isn't the optimal choice, and expensive lessons stick better than cheap advice.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                Why do you want to work with a stealth-mode AI-first EdTech startup instead of a more "comfortable" corporate job?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Because comfortable is boring, and education is too important to be boring. I've seen what AI can do when applied strategically - at AICAN, simple automation contributed to a $20K+ pipeline. But that's just scratching the surface. In EdTech, AI could personalize learning for millions of students, making education actually accessible instead of one-size-fits-all. In a corporate job, I'd be optimizing someone else's playbook. Here, we're writing the playbook. The uncertainty that scares most people is exactly what excites me - we get to figure out how to use AI to fundamentally change how people learn. That's worth some sleepless nights.
